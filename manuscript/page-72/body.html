We are going to stir them up in the paper tomorrow, Aslaksen.</p><p>Aslaksen. But not violently, I trust, Mr. Hovstad. Proceed with moderation, or you will do nothing with them. You may take my advice; I have gathered my experience in the school of life. Well, I must say goodbye, Doctor. You know now that we small tradesmen are at your back at all events, like a solid wall. You have the compact majority on your side Doctor.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. I am very much obliged, dear Mr. Aslaksen, (Shakes hands with him.) Goodbye, goodbye.</p><p>Aslaksen. Are you going my way, towards the printing-office. Mr. Hovstad?</p><p>Hovstad, I will come later; I have something to settle up first.</p></div> </div>
