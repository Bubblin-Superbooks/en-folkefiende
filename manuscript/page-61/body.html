<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Hovstad. I have given the matter a great deal of thought since last night.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. Well?</p><p>Hovstad. From your point of view, as a doctor and a man of science, this affair of the water supply is an isolated matter. I mean, you do not realise that it involves a great many other things.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. How do you mean?—Let us sit down, my dear fellow. No, sit here on the couch. (HOVSTAD Sits down on the couch, DR. STOCKMANN On a chair on the other side of the table.) Now then. You mean that—?</p><p>Hovstad. You said yesterday that the pollution of the water was due to impurities in the soil.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. Yes, unquestionably it is due to that poisonous morass up at Molledal.</p><p>Hovstad. Begging your pardon, Doctor, I fancy it is due to quite another morass altogether.</p></div> </div>
