<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Dr. Stockmann (standing still). What a strange woman you are, Katherine! Would you prefer to have the boys grow up in a society like this? You saw for yourself last night that half the population are out of their minds; and if the other half have not lost their senses, it is because they are mere brutes, with no sense to lose.</p><p>Mrs. Stockmann. But, Thomas dear, the imprudent things you said had something to do with it, you know.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. Well, isn't what I said perfectly true? Don't they turn every idea topsy-turvy? Don't they make a regular hotchpotch of right and wrong? Don't they say that the things I know are true, are lies? The craziest part of it all is the fact of these "liberals," men of full age, going about in crowds imagining that they are the broad-minded party! Did you ever hear anything like it, Katherine!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Mrs. Stockmann. Yes, yes, it's mad enough of them,</p></div> </div>
