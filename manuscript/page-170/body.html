<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Dr. Stockmann. Very well, gentlemen, I will say no more about our leading men. And if anyone imagines, from what I have just said, that my object is to attack these people this evening, he is wrong—absolutely wide of the mark. For I cherish the comforting conviction that these parasites—all these venerable relics of a dying school of thought—are most admirably paving the way for their own extinction; they need no doctor's help to hasten their end. Nor is it folk of that kind who constitute the most pressing danger to the community. It is not they who are most instrumental in poisoning the sources of our moral life and infecting the ground on which we stand. It is not they who are the most dangerous enemies of truth and freedom amongst us.</p><p>Shouts from all sides. Who then? Who is it? Name! Name!</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Dr. Stockmann. You may depend upon it—I shall name them! That is precisely the great discovery I made</p></div> </div>
