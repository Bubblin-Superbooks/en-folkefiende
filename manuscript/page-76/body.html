He is quite excited about my discovery, I find it has a much wider bearing than I at first imagined. And he has put his paper at my disposal if necessity should arise.</p><p>Mrs. Stockmann. Do you think it will?</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. Not for a moment. But at all events it makes me feel proud to know that I have the liberal-minded independent press on my side. Yes, and just imagine—I have had a visit from the Chairman of the Householders' Association!</p><p>Mrs. Stockmann. Oh! What did he want?</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. To offer me his support too.
