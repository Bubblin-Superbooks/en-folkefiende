Katherine, hasn't the postman been here?</p><p>Mrs. Stockmann (from the dining-room). No.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. And then to be comfortably off, Peter!

Indeed I can assure you we have often been very hard put to it, up there. And now to be able to live like a lord! Today, for instance, we had roast beef for dinner—and, what is more, for supper too. Won't you come and have a little bit? Or let me show it you, at any rate? Come here—</p><p>Peter Stockmann. No, no—not for worlds!</p></div> </div>
