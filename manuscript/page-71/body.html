<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">frank expression of a citizen's views.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann (shaking him by the hand). I can't tell you, dear Mr. Aslaksen, how extremely pleased I am to find such hearty support among my fellow-citizens. I am delightedâ€”delighted! Now, you will take a small glass of sherry, eh?</p><p>Aslaksen. No, thank you; I never drink alcohol of that kind.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. Well, what do you say to a glass of beer, then?</p><p>Aslaksen. Nor that either, thank you, Doctor. I never drink anything as early as this. I am going into town now to talk this over with one or two householders, and prepare the ground.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. It is tremendously kind of you, Mr. Aslaksen; but I really cannot understand the necessity for all these precautions. It seems to me that the thing should go of itself.</p></div> </div>
