You are not thinking of pulling down the Baths surely, Doctor?</p><p>Hovstad. Far from it, don't be afraid.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. No, we meant something quite different. Well, what do you think of my article, Mr. Hovstad?</p><p>Hovstad. I think it is simply a masterpiece.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. Do you really think so? Well, I am very pleased, very pleased.</p><p>Hovstad. It is so clear and intelligible. One need have no special knowledge to understand the bearing of it. You will have every enlightened man on your side.</p><p>Aslaksen. And every prudent man too, I hope?</p><p>Billing. The prudent and the imprudentâ€”almost the whole town.</p><p>Aslaksen.
