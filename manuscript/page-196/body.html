Oh, you will find a lot more yet, I expect.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann (adding the stone to a heap of others on the table). I shall treasure these stones as relics.

Yes, but he said he didn't know if he would be able to come today.</p><p>Dr. Stockmann. You will see he won't dare to come.</p><p>Mrs. Stockmann. Well, that is just what Randine thought—that he didn't dare to, on account of the neighbours. (Calls into the sitting-room.) What is it you want, Randine? Give it to me. (Goes in, and comes out again directly.) Here is a letter for you, Thomas.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Dr. Stockmann. Let me see it. (Opens and reads it.)</p></div> </div>
